            <h3> Our Mission </h3>
            <p> The website, Scholars Connect, aims to enable endless connection and collaboration between educators, students, and more on a centralized platform. It fosters a sense of community within education, lending support to others who are in the same field. </p>
            <p>Scholars Connect gives the opportunity to students to have a more engaging and effective studying experience, working with their peers and educators. Educators will also have the ability to guide or participate within study groups built and have the opportunity to receive feedback efficiently from their students. </p>
            <p>As a student myself, the need for time management and organization is key in striving to attain a better education. With the website, Scholars Connect, users will have the ability to coordinate their schedules correctly to fit in every priority of theirs. This allows them to sustain a healthy schedule throughout their education, balancing work life, personal, and school. Resources will be shared on the website, such as study guides, open-source tools, and other materials that users may find interesting. Communication will be apparent on the pages, with groups created and classrooms. </p>
